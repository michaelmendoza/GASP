# Notes

### Discusion

- Discovered we aren't using a full period for SSFP i.e. 4 pi

### Questions?

- Investigate complex valued forcing function 


### Things to do:

-[x] Create periodic forcing function
-[x] Mask things outside of a period so it isn't included in the calculation
-[x] Could also only consider the center line 
-[ ] Create simulation data and mimics phantom 
-[ ] Use field map from phantom data in simulation data
